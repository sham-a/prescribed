* Speech recognition is added to simplify adding their medications
* They can add notes to remind them of certain important comments related to their prescription
* COMING SOON: FAQ tab where they would be able to ask general questions and see other people's answers
* COMING SOON: Appointment tab where they can manage their appointments with their doctors and book one whenever they need it
